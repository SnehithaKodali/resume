- Feeding India is a non-profit organization that works on efficiently mobilizing food from various sources to those in need.
- As a team of 50 members at Shiv Nadar University, we were successful in feeding 1000 underprivileged children and visited multiple NGO's such as 'Prayas' to raise awareness on food wastage and importance of education.
