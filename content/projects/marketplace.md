Developed an Android application called UTA Thrift Store, which serves as a marketplace for buying and selling products among the student community.

Inspired from the challenge students face with acquiring and disposing utilities/products.

The application lets users register with basic information and assigns the selected role i.e., buyer or seller. An admin role is also available for monitoring and statistical analysis of user interactions to improve strategies.
