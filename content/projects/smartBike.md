Developed a “Smart Bike Sharing System” that enabled the students at our school to access a reliable, environment-friendly mode of transportation, inspired by the public sharing bicycle system in metropolitan cities. 

Built the mobile application using React Native for user interface that enabled user authentication, QR code scanner, a payment gateway that adds funds from Paytm and charges based on the usage time.
